"""General Learning-to-Answer Pipeline — meaning compiler + generative renderer
(Build GP-001).

Two stages live here:

  compile_meaning(...)  : sealed MEA manifest + solution -> MeaningManifest
  render(meaning)       : MeaningManifest -> natural-language answer text

About "generative" (this is the part that matters):
  The renderer does NOT select a finished sentence from a fixed list keyed to
  one fixture. It assembles the answer clause by clause from the *meaning
  fields* of THIS specific problem: the object noun, the operation, the given
  quantities, the ordered reasoning steps that were actually computed, the
  exact answer, and the verification. Different problems produce different
  sentences because the fields differ. There is no 144 Hz string in here and no
  per-problem template; the structure is general and the content is the data.

  It is non-LLM and deterministic: same meaning in, same words out. That makes
  it Echo-checkable. It is a first, honest generative layer — a real sentence
  planner over meaning, extensible with richer grammar later.

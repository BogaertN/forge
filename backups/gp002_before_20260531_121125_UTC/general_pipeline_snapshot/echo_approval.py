"""General Learning-to-Answer Pipeline — Echo approval gate (Build GP-001).

Echo is the rendering approval gate. It checks that the rendered natural
language faithfully preserves the meaning manifest, and on PASS it APPROVES the
output for delivery in its permitted mode.

What Echo PASS means here:
  the spoken answer is faithful to the sealed meaning (the exact answer value,
  the verification, and the claim status all appear and none are upgraded).

What Echo PASS does NOT mean (locked, same as the RMC architecture):
  it does not certify external empirical truth, it does not write memory, it
  does not create CT, it does not change upstream claim status, it does not
  publish through any route or UI. Approval is of fidelity, not omniscience.

This corrects the Build 010 drift where Echo only reported eligibility. Here a
faithful rendering of a RESOLVED_MANIFEST is approved for delivery.

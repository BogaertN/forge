# Patch 102 Engine Review Evidence Cross-Check

Engine: `loop_resurrection_engine`
Status: `EVIDENCE_CROSSCHECK_READY_NO_AUTHORITY`
Evidence ID: `EEB-608882f63d11dd95`
Candidate path: `/home/nic/aiweb/engines/loop_resurrection_engine`

## LLM Invocation
- Called: `True`
- Provider: `ollama`
- Model: `qwen3:8b`
- Status: `OLLAMA_VISIBLE_REVIEW_READY`
- Hidden reasoning stored: `False`

## Local LLM Visible Review

Plain-English Purpose:  
To queue previously archived loops for reintegration into active runtime, enabling them to be processed again.  

Likely System Role:  
A component of an AI web engine that manages symbolic loop resurrection, bridging cold storage archives with active execution contexts.  

Evidence Used:  
- `resurrect_loop` function writes loop IDs to a JSON queue file.  
- Test script validates resurrection queuing logic.  
- README.md and manifest describe the engine's purpose and components.  
- Queue file contains timestamped loop records.  

Risks / Uncertainties:  
- No evidence of error handling for failed resurrection attempts.  
- Unclear how the system ensures loops are successfully reactivated post-queuing.  
- Reliance on JSON file persistence could risk data loss if not properly managed.  

Recommendation Draft:  
Approve the engine's basic functionality but recommend additional testing for robustness, including error recovery and confirmation of successful loop reintegration.  

Suggested Nic Action:  
Approve review with a note to validate resurrection success metrics and implement safeguards for queue file integrity.
